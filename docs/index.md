# Job Platform Documentation

Welcome to the **Job Platform Project Documentation** — a comprehensive guide to the design, development, and functionality of the Job Portal web application.

---

## Introduction

The **Job Platform** is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the hiring and job-seeking process by bridging the gap between **job seekers** and **employers**.  

#### It enables:
- Job seekers to find and apply for jobs easily.  
- Employers to create, manage, and track job postings efficiently.  

The platform ensures **data security, scalability, and accessibility** through a role-based authentication and authorization model, powered by **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  It is built using **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **PostgreSQL**, with **AWS S3** for secure file storage.  

This project represents a real-world implementation of the above **Tech stack** with cloud integration and responsive design principles.
